      "I started loving computers when I was 12 years old, back then my Operative System was broken due to a Trojan virus that removed important startup files and I restored it by using only MS-DOS commands and copied the missing files from the installation CD into the Hard Drive. From that moment I felt how powerful are computers as well as by creating Software I could help other people to make their lifes easier, doing the Software they need to accomplish their work, improving their lifes and connecting with others."
